Project layout for a wildfly application using JavaEE8 deployed as an EAR archive that contains a JSF WAR and an EJB JAR


This example consists of the following Maven projects, each with a shared parent.

[cols="30%,70%",options="headers"]
|===
|Project |Description

| `ejb`
| This project contains the EJB code and can be built independently to produce the JAR archive.

| `web`
| This project contains the JSF pages and the managed bean.

| `ear`
| This project builds the EAR artifact and pulls in the EJB and web artifacts.
|===


== Requirements

* JavaSDK 8+
* Wildfly Application Server 16.0.0.Final Java EE Full & Web Distribution[https://wildfly.org/downloads/]
* Maven 3+

== Maven Setup

You will need to update/create a maven setting.xml file.   e.g. /User/<username>/.m2/settings.xml

 copy setting.xml  to /Users/<username>/.m2/


== Notes

* The project uses the default wildfly datasource  ExampleDS 
* It uses the H2 Database
* To view the database you need to deploy the h2-console [https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/tree/7.1.0.GA/h2-console]

== Sample Application

=== Requirement:

Create a JSF application using the JavaEE8 api.  It must demonstrate the following api

* Enterprise java beans (EJB)
* Entity Bean (JPA )
* Java Bean validation (BV)
* Contexts And Dependency Injection (CDI)
* Javaserver Faces 2.3 (JSF)


The JSF page must use the Primefaces Library (This is already in the pom.xml)
Donâ€™t worry about the UI and UX for the applications.  
I more interested in how you organise/structure your java code

The application will have 3 Entities and the following relationship between the entities

The Application must have the following functionality

* list the drivers using a <p:dataTable> 
* add a driver
* edit a driver
* add a new Taxi Ride.  On this page you have to select a driver, and add at least one new passenger or existing passengers from previous taxi rides.
* lists the taxi rides. You should be able to search/filter the tax rides by Date, driver, passengers. <p:calendar> and <p:pickList>

== H2 Console

Access the H2 Console

 You can access the console at the following URL: http://localhost:8080/h2-console/.

You need to enter the JDBC URL, and credentials. To access the test database that the greeter quickstart uses, enter these details:

----
JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:mem:test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE
User Name: sa
Password: sa
Click on the Test Connection button to make sure you can connect. If you can, go ahead and click Connect.
